                My Journey to Healing

                <p className="text-lg">
                  As a Psychotherapist & wellness coach specializing in Past Life Regressions, I support working professionals and creative visionaries to step confidently into their radiance and power.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My path to becoming a healer wasn't linear. Like many of the women I work with, I carried the weight of ancestral patterns that kept me from fully expressing my authentic self. It was through my own deep healing journey that I discovered the transformative power of combining traditional therapy with spiritual healing modalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the last 20 years, I've studied and integrated numerous healing modalities, developing a unique approach that addresses not just the symptoms, but the root causes of what keeps us stuck. I believe that true healing happens when we address the mind, body, and soul as one interconnected system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My work is deeply personal. I understand what it feels like to carry generational trauma, to feel disconnected from your purpose, and to struggle with trusting your inner voice. That's why I'm so passionate about helping women break these cyclesâ€”not just for themselves, but for the generations that follow.

                <p>
                  I believe that healing is not just about addressing symptoms, but about remembering who you truly are beneath the layers of conditioning, trauma, and inherited patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My approach combines the practical wisdom of psychology with the deep insights of spiritual healing. I work with you on multiple levelsâ€”mental, emotional, energetic, and ancestralâ€”to create lasting transformation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every session is tailored to your unique needs and where you are in your healing journey. I create a safe, sacred space where you can explore, heal, and reclaim the parts of yourself that have been hidden or wounded.

                My own healing journey began in my early twenties when I realized that despite having everything I thought I wanted, I felt empty and disconnected from my true self. I was carrying patterns of silence, people-pleasing, and self-doubt that I later discovered weren't even mineâ€”they belonged to the women in my lineage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through my own past-life regression work, I uncovered lifetimes where I had been silenced, persecuted for my gifts, and forced to hide my truth. These revelations helped me understand why I struggled to speak up, why I dimmed my light, and why I felt unsafe being fully seen.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I healed these patterns, everything in my life began to shift. I found my voice, stepped into my power, and discovered my true purpose. But more importantly, I realized that my healing was creating ripples of change throughout my entire family system.
